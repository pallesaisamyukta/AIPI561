# AIPI561

## Goal
The primary goal of this project is to create an AI-based solution that helps readers quickly catch up on previous books in a series. This is particularly useful when a new book is released after a significant gap, and readers may have forgotten key details from earlier books. By generating concise summaries or "things you need to know" lists, we enable readers to enjoy the latest book without needing to reread the entire series.

## Model Information
We leverage state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality summaries. The primary model used in this project is the mistralai/**Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2**, a powerful model known for its capability in text summarization and instruction-following tasks.

## Timeline

Week 3: Convert to Llamafile
- Convert Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 to llamafile format.
- Ensure compatibility and document the process.

Weeks 3-4: Testing Llamafile
- Test llamafile for accuracy and performance.
- Refine and debug as needed.
  
Weeks 5-7: Web Application Development
- Define features and design UI/UX.
- Develop frontend and backend.

Weeks 8-9: CI/CD and Dockerization
